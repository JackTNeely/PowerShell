The Active Directory schema isn't up-to-date, and this user account isn't a member of the 'Schema Admins' and/or
'Enterprise Admins' groups.

Setup encountered a problem while validating the state of Active Directory: Exchange organization-level objects have
not been created, and setup cannot create them because the local computer is not in the same domain and site as the
schema master. Run setup with the /prepareAD parameter on a computer in the domain fb and site HNS, and wait for
replication to complete. See the Exchange setup log for more information on this error.

The forest functional level of the current Active Directory forest is not Windows Server 2003 native or later. To
install Exchange Server 2016, the forest functional level must be at least Windows Server 2003 native.

Either Active Directory doesn't exist, or it can't be contacted.
